Description:
    Installs Fino Rails integration by creating an initializer file with default configuration.
    If fino-solid is installed, it will also run the fino:solid:install generator to create the database migration.

Example:
    bin/rails generate fino:rails:install

    This will create:
        config/initializers/fino.rb

    If fino-solid is installed, it will also create:
        db/migrate/[timestamp]_create_fino_settings.rb
